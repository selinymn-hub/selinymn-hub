# 👩‍🔬 Selin Yaman, Ph.D.
### Product Strategy & AI/ML Leader | Electrification | Control Systems | Digital Twin Innovation  

I'm a Product Manager and AI/ML strategist with 8+ years of experience bridging advanced control systems, electrification, and intelligent engineering tools.  
I specialize in turning complex technical systems into scalable, user-centric products, most recently at **John Deere**, where I lead **AI-driven electrification and validation platforms** powering next-generation off-road vehicles.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On
- **AI-enabled validation frameworks** that learn from simulation data to predict control-loop instability and NVH anomalies — reducing debugging time by 40%.
- **“Electrification Copilot”**, an internal AI assistant that guides engineers through model validation workflows, automates documentation, and surfaces reusable digital-twin assets.
- **Enterprise GitHub integrations** for MATLAB/Simulink and SysML-based modeling, accelerating collaboration and version traceability across distributed teams.
- **Product strategy & cross-functional leadership** for $10M+ electrification software platforms, aligning technical feasibility with customer and business goals.
